I am a Senior Scientist in the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zürich, hosted by John Lygeros. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department at the University of Pennsylvania working with prof. George Pappas. I was a graduate research assistant with prof. Petros Maragos in Computer Vision, Speech Communication and Signal Processing Group at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I did my undergraduate thesis and research with prof. Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos in Control Systems Laboratory at NTUA. I received the diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

Research Overview
======
My current research lies in the intersection of control theory and machine learning. Learning-based control emerges as a promising solution for modern control applications, where adaptation to complex and unknown environments is required. Despite recent progress, we still do not fully understand the impact and limitations of learning algorithms on even simple control systems. My goal is to understand these limitations and develop algorithms that are efficient and safe.

I am interested in the theoretical foundations of learning-based control. My goal is to understand what makes learning easy or hard. How do system properties affect learning difficulty? When is an algorithms optimal? Sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to achieve good performance, is one way of capturing this difficulty.

and how system theoretic properties fundamentally affect the difficulty of learning in system identification, online estimation and control. In particular, I focus on the statistical difficulty of learning, which is captured by the sample complexity, namely the number of samples needed to achieve satisfactory identification/control performance. I am also interested in online and data-driven control.

Previously, I also worked on risk-aware optimization and control. Critical applications require that stochastic decisions for estimation and control are made not only on the basis of minimizing average losses, but also safeguarding against less frequent, though possibly catastrophic events. I am interested in designing algorithms that compensate for such extreme events at the cost of only slightly sacrificing average performance. I also worked on security and privacy in networked control systems. My main focus has been eavesdropping attacks in the case of remote estimation and motion planning.
