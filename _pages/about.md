I am a Senior Scientist in the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zürich, hosted by John Lygeros. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department at the University of Pennsylvania working with prof. George Pappas. I was a graduate research assistant with prof. Petros Maragos in Computer Vision, Speech Communication and Signal Processing Group at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I did my undergraduate thesis and research with prof. Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos in Control Systems Laboratory at NTUA. I received the diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

Research Overview
======
My current research lies in the intersection of control theory and machine learning. Modern control applications require systems that can adapt to complex, unknown, and changing environments. Learning-based control emerges as a promising solution, augmenting traditional feedback control by exploiting data. Despite recent progress, we still do not fully understand the impact of learning algorithms on even simple control systems.

In my research,I am interested in understanding how system theoretic properties fundamentally affect the difficulty of learning in system identification, online estimation and control. In particular, I focus on the statistical difficulty of learning, which is captured by the sample complexity, namely the number of samples needed to achieve satisfactory identification/control performance. I am also interested in online and data-driven control.

Previously, I also worked on risk-aware optimization and control. Critical applications require that stochastic decisions for estimation and control are made not only on the basis of minimizing average losses, but also safeguarding against less frequent, though possibly catastrophic events. I am interested in designing algorithms that compensate for such extreme events at the cost of only slightly sacrificing average performance. I also worked on security and privacy in networked control systems. My main focus has been eavesdropping attacks in the case of remote estimation and motion planning.
