I am a Senior Scientist in the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zürich, hosted by John Lygeros. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department at the University of Pennsylvania working with prof. George Pappas. I was a graduate research assistant with prof. Petros Maragos in Computer Vision, Speech Communication and Signal Processing Group at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I did my undergraduate thesis and research with prof. Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos in Control Systems Laboratory at NTUA. I received the diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

Research Interests
======
Control Theory, Learning-based Control, Statistical Learning Theory, Online Learning and Optimization, Robust Control, Risk-Sensitive Control

Research Overview
======
Modern control applications require systems that can adapt to complex and unknow environments. Learning-based control emerges as a promising solution, augmenting traditional feedback loops with data. Despite the recent progress, we still do not fully understand the impact of learning algorithms on even simple control systems.
