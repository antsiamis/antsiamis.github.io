I am a Senior Scientist in the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zürich, working with John Lygeros. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE) department at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) working with prof. George Pappas. Previously, I was a graduate research assistant with prof. Petros Maragos in Computer Vision, Speech Communication and Signal Processing Group (CVSP) at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I did my undergraduate thesis and research with prof. Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos in Control Systems Laboratory (CSL) at NTUA. I received the diploma (MEng, five-year degree) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at NTUA
